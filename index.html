    <h3>Sunset in Morocco</h3>
    <img src='photos/Morocco_Sunset.jpg' alt="Morocco Sunset">
        <p>Gazing upon the sea of dunes cascading around me, I wonder how far can I walk upon this sand. 
    Will I overcome the harsh sun and reach my camp? Will the rays sink me into the golden abyss? 
    No matter the result: the only answer will come with one step forward.</p>

    <h3>Diamond Lights</h3>
    <img src='photos/Arches.jpg' alt="Arches of Moab">
        <p>No lights. I stand, enveloped by darkness. My vision alive only by the sea of stars above, gleaming faintly upon them.
             The silent, cold air pricks my skin, hardening it with every sharp gust. My lens stares into the glimmering abyss above, recording every light that sparkles before it collapses in exhaustion.
             The sky twirls the earth gently, and they dance together for eternity.</p>

    <h3>Thin Flames</h3>
    <img src='photos/Steel.jpg' alt="Steel Wool">
        <p>Sparks dance around my body, crashing and scorching the wooden earth. Water surrounds me to save me from an infernal accident, but with proper care, I thrive.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <h4>Software Engineer, Photographer, Nintendo Enthusiast</h4>
    <img src='photos/Mekaal_E_Ahmad.jpg' alt="Profile">
    <p>I am currently attending General Assembly as a student of the Software Engineering Immersive program. With this program, I hope to develop an advanced set of skills to benefit others. I hope to master website creation, and craft many successful projects.</p>
    <p>Outside of General Assembly, I am a photographer who focuses on capturing the night sky, landscapes, and nature. I hope that with this portfolio, I can not only display my Software Engineering projects, but also market my photography to a wide audience.</p>

    <h4>Xenoblade Chronicles X Deserved Better</h4>
    <img src='photos/Xenoblade_title.jpg' alt="Xenoblade Chronicles X">
    <p>Why on earth can't we get a damn sequel to Xenoblade Chronicles X?! That's my favorite game of all time! When will Nintendo and Monolith Soft actually grow up AND MAKE A SEQUEL! That or tell us that we have no game! At least we'd accept that!</p>

    <h4>Why Byleth Deserves to be in Smash Bros.</h4>
    <img src='photos/Byleth.jpg' alt="Byleth Smash Bros.">
    <p>Byleth has amazing potential as a new swordfighter, but they are held back from the stigma of being another Fire Emblem character.  Fire Emblem representation in Smash Bros. may be oversaturated, but we need to understand that the series is now a revenue juggernaut for Nintendo.</p>
