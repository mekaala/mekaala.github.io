For my portfolio, I am starting out with a basic grid layout.
My header features basic information such as the title of my website and links to my instagram and Linkedin profiles.
My left column features a developing 'Skills' section with a link to my resume and a list of skills I have acquired from General Assembly.
The main section now contains my list of projects. Each project includes a title that links to the project page, a preview photo, and a description. I will include a GitHub link below.
The right column features my photography as a placeholder, and may be omitted.
Finally, my footer features an About modal that opens my profile picture and a brief description of myself, along with the three links to my different accounts as seen in the header.
