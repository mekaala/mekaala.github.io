    <h2>Sunset in Morocco</h2>
        <p>Gazing upon the sea of dunes cascading around me, I wonder how far can I walk upon this sand. 
    Will I overcome the harsh sun and reach my camp? Will the rays sink me into the golden abyss? 
    No matter the result: the only answer will come with one step forward.</p>
