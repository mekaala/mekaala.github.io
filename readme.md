For my portfolio, I decided to take the opportunity to explore my photography.
My header features basic information such as the title of my website and links to my instagram and Linkedin profiles.
My left column features a developing 'About Me' section with my professional profile picture. I want to make my photo interactive and let it link to my Linkedin, but for now I'll keep that in the header.
The Main features photos that I have taken, and I plan to add more of them soon.
The right column features a geeky side of me, and serves as a placeholder for my SEI portfolio.
Finally, my footer just has basic information.
