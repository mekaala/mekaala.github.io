    <h2>Sunset in Morocco</h2>
    <img src='photos/Morocco_Sunset.jpg' alt="Morocco Sunset">
        <p>Gazing upon the sea of dunes cascading around me, I wonder how far can I walk upon this sand. 
    Will I overcome the harsh sun and reach my camp? Will the rays sink me into the golden abyss? 
    No matter the result: the only answer will come with one step forward.</p>

    <h3>Rants of a Nintendo Fanboy</h3>
    <p>Xenoblade X deserved better.</p>
    <p>But seriously, why on earth can't we get a damn sequel to Xenoblade Chronicles X?! That's my favorite game of all time! When will Nintendo and Monolith Soft actually grow up AND MAKE A SEQUEL! That or tell us that we have no game! At least we'd accept that!</p>
